Data Editing, Combining, and Classification Tool
This Python program can be used to edit, combine, and classify data extracted from Wireshark or similar network data analysis tools. The program includes the following core functionalities:

Data Editing: Editing CSV format data files. It allows for removing specific columns and selecting a portion of the dataset.

Data Combining: Combining two CSV files. It merges two different datasets row-wise to create a single dataset.

Classification Algorithms: Classifying datasets using classification algorithms. Users can classify the dataset by selecting one of the different classification algorithms such as RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, GaussianNB (Naive Bayes), or ZeroRClassifier.

The program aims to make data analysis and classification processes easier and faster. Its user-friendly interface helps to manage the data processing workflow effectively.
